# SmartSnake

This is the classic Snake game but with some Machine Learning envolved. [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
So you can use hand gestures to play the game!

If you want you can change it and adapt it to do whatever you want with it.

## Introduction

The SmartSnake game is a very simple version that can be upgraded at any time. I used [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) help to do this, feel free to check the website and some of their projects.
